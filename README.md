# TCP-SYN-attack-and-detection
Created 2 python scripts. The first script allow a user to launch a TCP SYN attack on a target IP address with various modes that allow the attack to change the intensity of the attack or change their source IP. The Second script is a detection script that would try to detect if the user's machine is being attacked by DOS.
